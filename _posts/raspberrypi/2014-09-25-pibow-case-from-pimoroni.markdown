I bought the [Pibow case][Pibow] (Toxic Yellow) from [Pimoroni](http://shop.pimoroni.com/) ages ago, it is such a sturdy and bright case - I thought I would take some pictures and deconstruct it...

## Case Fully Assembled

## Case Components

This is how the [PiBow][PiBow] looks in its individual components after you have taken off the protection film. Not included in shot is the plastic threads, nuts and nut spinny thing

Then take some arty shots to show off the case fully :-)

This is the base piece, you wont get to see it very often, but here is a picture of it. Note the Lego holes and additional holes for the [Raspberry Pi][rpi] B Model screw mounts

The top has the nice [Raspberry Pi][rpi] Logo with integrated vent and a slot for the camera cable to go through

## No Tools Required

That's because they are included with the case:- here is the Nut turner thing, very useful for spinning around and tightening up the nuts

## Lego mounts

A good part of the case is the inclusion of the Lego mount holes. Here I have just used an R2 Unit to balance the case on its head, but you could use this as a wall mount or anything you can imagine...

## Wrap up

This is a really good case, if you want a [Rapsberry Pi][rpi] case, I would recommend the [PiBow][pibow]
