I have been aggregating images from [Instagram][3] that relate to [Raspberry Pi][1] & [Arduino][2]. They are then posted to my Tumblr Blogs and then Tweeted to the world. Some of the projects are starter projects, but then there are some Robots, Sensors and Flying Machines...

## Raspberry Pi - Insta-RaspPi

+ [Twitter][4]
+ [Tumblr Blog][5] 

Currently has over 5,000 posts of things to do with a [Raspberry Pi][1]


## Arduino - Insta-Arduino

+ [Twitter][6]
+ [Tumblr Blog][7]

At time of this post, it currently has over 10,000 Posts of images related to [Arduino][2]

Follow them if you want, there are some brilliant images that get posted, my Tumblr posts contain the link back to the originating image, so all credit is always given back to the person who posted the picture.

Have fun, and post your images too
