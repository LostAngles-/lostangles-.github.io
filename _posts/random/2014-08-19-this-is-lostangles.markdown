Hi, My name is Lee, LeeT in fact ! I have been using and supporting computers for over a decade (probably 2) and recently I have got interested into [Raspberry Pi][1] &amp; [Arduino][2]. The little small powered devices that you can do anything with.

I tend to put things off, bad habit. So I am going to try and use this blog to force myself to post information/guides, to improve my learning and push myself. This is posted on [Github][3] so any mistakes I make (which I will, I am learning) can be pointed out and changed.

The places to follow me, if you so do wish:

+ [Twitter][4]
+ [Instagram][5]
+ [Github][6]

So, onwards...
